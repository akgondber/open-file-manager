## Usage

```typescript
import { openFileManager } from "open-file-manager";
// or
import openFileManager from "open-file-manager";
```

## API

### openFileManager

Opens a file or directory in the system's default file manager.

```typescript
export const openFileManager = async (dirname?: string): Promise<void>;
```

**Basic usage:**

```ts
// Open current directory
await openFileManager();

// Open specific directory
await openFileManager("/home/user/documents");

// Open file location (selects the file in the file manager)
await openFileManager("./package.json");
```

**Parameters:**

**pathname** (optional)

- Type: `string`
- Default: `'.'` (current directory)
- Path to the file or directory to open. Can be absolute or relative.

**Returns:**

- Type: `Promise<void>`
- Resolves when the file manager opens successfully
- Throws an error if the operation fails

**Platform behavior:**

- **Windows**: Uses `explorer.exe`. When opening a file, it selects the file in Explorer.
- **macOS**: Uses `open -R` to reveal the item in Finder.
- **Linux/Unix**: Tries multiple file managers in order: xdg-open, nautilus, dolphin, thunar, pcmanfm, nemo.

**Error handling:**

```ts
try {
  await openFileManager("/path/to/file");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to open file manager:", error.message);
}
```

## CLI

```bash
# Open current directory
open-file-manager

# Open specific directory
open-file-manager /home/user/documents

# Open file location
open-file-manager ./package.json

# Show help
open-file-manager --help

# Show version
open-file-manager --version
```

## Examples

### Open a project's dist folder

```ts
import { openFileManager } from "open-file-manager";

await openFileManager("./dist");
```

### Open a file's location

```ts
// This will open the file manager and select/highlight the file
await openFileManager("./README.md");
```

### Use in npm scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "open:dist": "open-file-manager ./dist",
    "open:current": "open-file-manager"
  }
}
```

### Cross-platform usage

```ts
import { openFileManager } from "open-file-manager";
import path from "node:path";

// Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
await openFileManager('/path/to/dir');
```

## Notes

- All paths are resolved relative to the current working directory
- The function is async and returns a Promise
- On Windows, if a file doesn't exist, it will open the parent directory instead
- On Linux, the function will try multiple file managers and use the first one available
- Supports FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and SunOS in addition to major platforms
